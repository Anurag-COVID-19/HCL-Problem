# HCL-Problem3

Design a  binary tree and then print the breadth first order traversal of this tree. In breadth first order traversal, 
we visit the nodes of same height first then go to nodes of next height or level.
     1

      \

       2

        \

         5	
		
        /  \

       3    6

        \

         4 

For the above tree, the level order traversal is 1 -> 2 -> 5 -> 3 -> 6 -> 4.
